###About Me
I am an entrepreneur with a background in the sciences and arts, and I focus on harnessing technological advances to find solutions to important problems.

I studied Physics & Philosophy at University and graduated in 2012. Some argued the contrasting subjects were incompatible, but I thought then and still think now that an education in a STEM subject combined with one in the arts is highly beneficial. They are complementary because there isn't a division between quantitative or qualitative thinking, rather it is a continuum.

An important 2012 ECJ (European Court of Justice) confirmed that the first-sale doctrine applied to software licenses when certain conditions were met. I co-founded and ran a company that enabled customers to take advantage of the newly established secondary software licensing market.

I am currently interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and its applications commercially in e-commerce and healthcare.

My interests are wide and varied, but I particularly love travelling. In addition to living in Hong Kong and Germany, I have travelled the world extensively.It had expanded my horizons greatly. Literature, stargazing, movies, music, art exhibitions, theatre, hiking and running beguiles me throughout the year.
